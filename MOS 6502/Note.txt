This project is my final bachelor’s thesis (Licence).
It consists of creating a custom microprocessor inspired by the 6502, the famous processor used by Steve Jobs in early Apple computers.

The repository contains two main folders:

Code/ — includes two subfolders:

sim/ → contains the simulation testbench (requires Bash, Git, and VS Code). A Makefile is provided to automate the simulation and compilation tasks.

src/ → contains the Verilog source code, which has already been compiled.

Doc/ — includes documentation explaining the datapath, control unit, and the top-level architecture of the microprocessor.

This project demonstrates my skills in digital design, computer architecture, and hardware description languages (HDL).
